### 📝 Lesson 2: Sentence

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It usually contains a subject and a verb and can make a statement, ask a question, or give an order. There are four main types of sentences in English. Each type serves a different purpose and ends with a different punctuation mark.

1. **Declarative Sentences**: Provide information or state facts. End with a period.

   * Example: "The weather is sunny today."
2. **Interrogative Sentences**: Ask questions. End with a question mark.

   * Example: "What time is the meeting?"
3. **Exclamatory Sentences**: Show strong feelings or surprise. End with an exclamation mark.

   * Example: "Wow, that’s amazing!"
4. **Imperative Sentences**: Give commands, suggestions, or requests. They may end with either an exclamation mark or a period.

   * Example: "Please pass me the salt." / "Stop right there!"

* **Subject**: The person or thing performing the action.
* **Predicate**: The part of the sentence that tells what the subject does.

**Example**: "The young boy waited in line at the shop."

---

### 📝 Lesson 3: Nouns and Pronouns

#### **Nouns**

A noun is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns often serve as the subject of the sentence.

**Types of Nouns**:

* **Common Nouns**: General names like "dog," "city," or "car."
* **Proper Nouns**: Specific names, always capitalized, such as "John," "Paris," or "The Mona Lisa."

### 🧠 Countable Nouns:

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| a few, several, a number of, many | a little, much, a great deal of | some, any, plenty of, none |

A pronoun replaces a noun to avoid repetition. There are several types of pronouns:

**Types of Pronouns**:

### 📝 Lesson 4: Subject-Verb Agreement

Learn how to match subjects and verbs correctly — a must for building good English sentences.

#### **The Basics**:

* Singular subject → Singular verb

  * Example: Emma writes a blog.
* Plural subject → Plural verb

  * Example: They travel every summer.

#### **Examples**:

| **Singular**                 | **Plural**                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The cat sleeps on the couch. | The birds fly in the sky.  |
| He works at a bookstore.     | Nurses care for patients.  |

Open questions invite detailed answers. They usually start with a question word like **What** or **Why** and help create natural, flowing conversation.

### ✅ Structure:

**Question Word + Auxiliary Verb (e.g., is, was, are, were, do, does, did, will, could, might) + Subject + Main Verb**

### ❓ Common Question Words:

* **What** – for things or ideas
* **Where** – for locations
