### 📝 Lesson 1: Parts of Speech

English has 9 parts of speech that build sentences:

| **Part**            | **Role**           | **Examples**      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 🧍 **Noun**         | Person/place/thing | David, city, book |
| 🙋 **Pronoun**      | Replaces nouns     | He, she, it       |
| 🏃 **Verb**         | Action/state       | Run, laugh, is    |
| 🐢 **Adverb**       | Describes verbs    | Quickly, softly   |
| 🌟 **Adjective**    | Describes nouns    | Big, happy        |
| 📰 **Article**      | Defines nouns      | A, an, the        |
| 🔗 **Conjunction**  | Connects ideas     | And, but, because |
| 📍 **Preposition**  | Shows place/time   | In, on, after     |
| 🎉 **Interjection** | Expresses emotion  | Wow!, Oh no!      |

📌 These are the building blocks of clear, correct sentences.

### 📝 Lesson 2: Understanding Sentences

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It usually contains a subject and a verb and can make a statement, ask a question, or give an order.

* **Subject**: The person or thing performing the action.
* **Predicate**: The part of the sentence that tells what the subject does.

**Example**: "The young boy waited in line at the shop."

**Sentence Structure**:
The subject is the who or what that is doing the action, and the predicate is the action or state being described.

---

### 📝 Lesson 3: Basic Sentence Types

There are four main types of sentences in English. Each type serves a different purpose and ends with a different punctuation mark.

1. **Declarative Sentences**: Provide information or state facts. End with a period.

   * Example: "The weather is sunny today."
2. **Interrogative Sentences**: Ask questions. End with a question mark.

   * Example: "What time is the meeting?"
3. **Exclamatory Sentences**: Show strong feelings or surprise. End with an exclamation mark.

   * Example: "Wow, that’s amazing!"
4. **Imperative Sentences**: Give commands, suggestions, or requests. They may end with either an exclamation mark or a period.

   * Example: "Please pass me the salt." / "Stop right there!"

---

### 📝 Lesson 4: Mastering Nouns and Pronouns

#### **Nouns**

A noun is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns often serve as the subject of the sentence.

**Types of Nouns**:

* **Common Nouns**: General names like "dog," "city," or "car."
* **Proper Nouns**: Specific names, always capitalized, such as "John," "Paris," or "The Mona Lisa."
* **Abstract Nouns**: Ideas or concepts like "freedom," "happiness," or "love."
* **Concrete Nouns**: Things we can see or touch, like "book," "apple," or "computer."
* **Countable Nouns**: Things you can count, such as "apple" or "child."
* **Uncountable Nouns**: Things that cannot be counted individually, like "water," "rice," or "advice."

#### **Pronouns**

A pronoun replaces a noun to avoid repetition. There are several types of pronouns:

**Types of Pronouns**:

* **Personal Pronouns**: Replace specific nouns. Examples: "he," "she," "it," "we," "they."
* **Reflexive Pronouns**: Indicate the subject and object are the same, ending in “-self” or “-selves.” Examples: "myself," "yourself," "themselves."
* **Demonstrative Pronouns**: Point to specific things. Examples: "this," "that," "these," "those."
* **Interrogative Pronouns**: Used to ask questions. Examples: "who," "what," "where."
* **Indefinite Pronouns**: Refer to non-specific things or people. Examples: "everyone," "somebody," "anything."

---

### 📝 Lesson 5: Possessive Forms

Possession indicates ownership and can be shown with apostrophes in writing.

* **Singular Possession**: "David’s pen"
* **Plural Possession**: "The shops’ doors"
* **Possessive Pronouns**: Replace the possessive adjective + noun (e.g., "This is my book" → "This book is mine").

---

### 📝 Lesson 6: Demonstratives and Possession

#### **Demonstratives**

Demonstratives are words used to point to specific things or show emphasis.

* **This**: Refers to something close.
* **That**: Refers to something farther away.
* **These**: Refers to multiple things close.
* **Those**: Refers to multiple things farther away.

**Examples**:

* This book is amazing.
* I can see those cars.

#### **Possessive Pronouns**

Possessive pronouns show ownership. They replace a possessive adjective and a noun.

* **Mine** (for "my")
* **Yours** (for "your")
* **His** (for "his")
* **Hers** (for "her")
* **Ours** (for "our")
* **Theirs** (for "their")

---

### 📝 Lesson 7: Verbs & Irregular Verbs

#### **Verbs**

Verbs = Action or state words. They change with tense:

* **She laughs** (present)
* **He walked** (past)
* **They have studied** (past participle)

**Regular Verbs** follow a pattern:

* Walk → Walked → Walked
* Cook → Cooked → Cooked

**Irregular Verbs** have no fixed rule and must be memorized:

* Go → Went → Gone
* Buy → Bought → Bought

**Grouped for easier learning**:

| **Group**         | **Example**               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| All same          | Put → Put → Put           |
| Past = Participle | Bring → Brought → Brought |
| Base = Participle | Become → Became → Become  |
| All different     | Wake → Woke → Woken       |

💡 Practice + repetition = mastery!

### 📝 Lesson 8: Subject-Verb Agreement

Learn how to match subjects and verbs correctly — a must for building good English sentences.

#### **The Basics**:

* Singular subject → Singular verb

  * Example: Emma writes a blog.
* Plural subject → Plural verb

  * Example: They travel every summer.

#### **Examples**:

| **Singular**                 | **Plural**                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The cat sleeps on the couch. | The birds fly in the sky.  |
| He works at a bookstore.     | Nurses care for patients.  |
| This phone rings loudly.     | Cars honk on busy streets. |

#### **Helping (Auxiliary) Verbs**:

Used in negatives or questions:

* ✅ She does enjoy music.
* ✅ They do cook at home.
* ❌ She do enjoy...
* ❌ They does cook...

#### **Special Cases**:

* **Two Singular Subjects**: Tom and Lisa bake cookies together.
* **Indefinite Pronouns**: Words like "everyone," "somebody," "nobody" use singular verbs:

  * Somebody left the door open.
  * Nobody knows the answer.
