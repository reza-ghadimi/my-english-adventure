### 📝 Lesson 2: Forming Questions in English

Asking questions is one of the most important communication skills in any language. It helps us:

* Get information
* Continue conversations
* Show interest in others
* Clarify things we don’t understand

In English, questions fall into two main types: **Closed Questions** and **Open Questions**.

---

## 🔒 **Closed Questions**

Closed questions are used when you only need **a short answer** — usually “Yes” or “No”.

### ✅ Structure:

**Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### 📌 Common Auxiliary Verbs:

* **Present / Past Simple:** Do / Does / Did
* **Be verb forms:** Is / Are / Was / Were
* **Modals:** Can / Could / Will / Would / Should

### 🗣️ Examples:

| Question                | Possible Answers                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Are you tired?          | Yes, I am. / No, I’m not.       |
| Did she eat lunch?      | Yes, she did. / No, she didn’t. |
| Is this your bag?       | Yes, it is. / No, it isn’t.     |
| Will you come tomorrow? | Yes, I will. / No, I won’t.     |
| Could you help me?      | Sure! / Sorry, I can’t.         |

> **Tip:** Closed questions are useful for checking facts or confirming details.

## 🔓 **Open Questions**

Open questions are used when you want **more information**, not just “yes” or “no.” These usually begin with **question words**.

### ✅ Structure:

**Question Word + Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### ❓ The 6 Main Question Words:

* **What** – for things/information
* **Where** – for places
* **When** – for time
* **Who** – for people
* **Why** – for reasons
* **How** – for manner/process

### 🗣️ Examples:

| Question                          | Sample Answers                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
