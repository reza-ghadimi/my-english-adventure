### 📝 Lesson 2: Forming Questions in English

Asking questions is one of the most useful skills in any language. It allows us to:

* Get new information
* Keep conversations going
* Show interest in people and ideas
* Clarify what we don’t understand

English questions fall into two main types: **Closed Questions** and **Open Questions**.

---

## 🔒 **Closed Questions**

Closed questions ask for short, direct answers — often just “Yes” or “No”.

### ✅ Structure:

**Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### 📌 Common Auxiliary Verbs:

* **Be verbs:** Is / Are / Was / Were
* **Present / Past Simple:** Do / Does / Did
* **Modals:** Will / Would / Can / Could / Should

### 🗣️ Examples:

| Question                | Possible Answers                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Are you tired?          | Yes, I am. / No, I’m not.       |
| Did she eat lunch?      | Yes, she did. / No, she didn’t. |
| Is this your bag?       | Yes, it is. / No, it isn’t.     |
| Will you come tomorrow? | Yes, I will. / No, I won’t.     |
| Could you help me?      | Sure! / Sorry, I can’t.         |

> **Tip:** Use closed questions to confirm facts, check availability, or make decisions quickly.

---

## 🔓 **Open Questions**

Open questions invite detailed answers. They usually start with a question word like **What** or **Why** and help create natural, flowing conversation.

### ✅ Structure:

**Question Word + Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### ❓ Common Question Words:

* **What** – for things or ideas
* **Where** – for locations
* **When** – for time
* **Who** – for people
* **Why** – for reasons
* **How** – for manner or process

### 🗣️ Examples:

| Question                          | Sample Answers                               |
