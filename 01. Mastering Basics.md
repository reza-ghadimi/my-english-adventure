### 📝 Lesson 1: Parts of Speech

English has 9 parts of speech that build sentences:

| **Part**            | **Role**           | **Examples**      |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 🧍 **Noun**         | Person/place/thing | David, city, book |
| 🙋 **Pronoun**      | Replaces nouns     | He, she, it       |
| 🏃 **Verb**         | Action/state       | Run, laugh, is    |
| 🐢 **Adverb**       | Describes verbs    | Quickly, softly   |
| 🌟 **Adjective**    | Describes nouns    | Big, happy        |
| 📰 **Article**      | Defines nouns      | A, an, the        |

| 📍 **Preposition**  | Shows place/time   | In, on, after     |

📌 These are the building blocks of clear, correct sentences.

### 📝 Lesson 2: Understanding Sentences

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It usually contains a subject and a verb and can make a statement, ask a question, or give an order.

* **Subject**: The person or thing performing the action.
* **Predicate**: The part of the sentence that tells what the subject does.

**Example**: "The young boy waited in line at the shop."

**Sentence Structure**:
The subject is the who or what that is doing the action, and the predicate is the action or state being described.

### 📝 Lesson 3: Basic Sentence Types

There are four main types of sentences in English. Each type serves a different purpose and ends with a different punctuation mark.

1. **Declarative Sentences**: Provide information or state facts. End with a period.

   * Example: "The weather is sunny today."
2. **Interrogative Sentences**: Ask questions. End with a question mark.

   * Example: "What time is the meeting?"
3. **Exclamatory Sentences**: Show strong feelings or surprise. End with an exclamation mark.

   * Example: "Wow, that’s amazing!"
4. **Imperative Sentences**: Give commands, suggestions, or requests. They may end with either an exclamation mark or a period.

   * Example: "Please pass me the salt." / "Stop right there!"

### 📝 Lesson 4: Mastering Nouns and Pronouns

#### **Nouns**

A noun is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns often serve as the subject of the sentence.

**Types of Nouns**:

* **Common Nouns**: General names like "dog," "city," or "car."
* **Proper Nouns**: Specific names, always capitalized, such as "John," "Paris," or "The Mona Lisa."
* **Abstract Nouns**: Ideas or concepts like "freedom," "happiness," or "love."
* **Concrete Nouns**: Things we can see or touch, like "book," "apple," or "computer."
* **Countable Nouns**: Things you can count, such as "apple" or "child."
* **Uncountable Nouns**: Things that cannot be counted individually, like "water," "rice," or "advice."

#### **Pronouns**

A pronoun replaces a noun to avoid repetition. There are several types of pronouns:

**Types of Pronouns**:

* **Personal Pronouns**: Replace specific nouns. Examples: "he," "she," "it," "we," "they."
* **Reflexive Pronouns**: Indicate the subject and object are the same, ending in “-self” or “-selves.” Examples: "myself," "yourself," "themselves."
* **Demonstrative Pronouns**: Point to specific things. Examples: "this," "that," "these," "those."
* **Interrogative Pronouns**: Used to ask questions. Examples: "who," "what," "where."
* **Indefinite Pronouns**: Refer to non-specific things or people. Examples: "everyone," "somebody," "anything."

### 📝 Lesson 5: Possessive Forms

Possession indicates ownership and can be shown with apostrophes in writing.

* **Singular Possession**: "David’s pen"
* **Plural Possession**: "The shops’ doors"
* **Possessive Pronouns**: Replace the possessive adjective + noun (e.g., "This is my book" → "This book is mine").

---

### 📝 Lesson 6: Demonstratives and Possession

#### **Demonstratives**

Demonstratives are words used to point to specific things or show emphasis.

* **This**: Refers to something close.
* **That**: Refers to something farther away.
* **These**: Refers to multiple things close.
* **Those**: Refers to multiple things farther away.

**Examples**:

* This book is amazing.
* I can see those cars.

#### **Possessive Pronouns**

Possessive pronouns show ownership. They replace a possessive adjective and a noun.

* **Mine** (for "my")
* **Yours** (for "your")
* **His** (for "his")
* **Hers** (for "her")
* **Ours** (for "our")
* **Theirs** (for "their")

### 📝 Lesson 7: Verbs & Irregular Verbs

#### **Verbs**

Verbs = Action or state words. They change with tense:

* **She laughs** (present)
* **He walked** (past)
* **They have studied** (past participle)

**Regular Verbs** follow a pattern:

* Walk → Walked → Walked
* Cook → Cooked → Cooked

**Irregular Verbs** have no fixed rule and must be memorized:

* Go → Went → Gone
* Buy → Bought → Bought

**Grouped for easier learning**:

| **Group**         | **Example**               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| All same          | Put → Put → Put           |
| Past = Participle | Bring → Brought → Brought |
| Base = Participle | Become → Became → Become  |
| All different     | Wake → Woke → Woken       |

💡 Practice + repetition = mastery!

### 📝 Lesson 8: Subject-Verb Agreement

Learn how to match subjects and verbs correctly — a must for building good English sentences.

#### **The Basics**:

* Singular subject → Singular verb

  * Example: Emma writes a blog.
* Plural subject → Plural verb

  * Example: They travel every summer.

#### **Examples**:

| **Singular**                 | **Plural**                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The cat sleeps on the couch. | The birds fly in the sky.  |
| He works at a bookstore.     | Nurses care for patients.  |
| This phone rings loudly.     | Cars honk on busy streets. |

#### **Helping (Auxiliary) Verbs**:

Used in negatives or questions:

* ✅ She does enjoy music.
* ✅ They do cook at home.
* ❌ She do enjoy...
* ❌ They does cook...

#### **Special Cases**:

* **Two Singular Subjects**: Tom and Lisa bake cookies together.
* **Indefinite Pronouns**: Words like "everyone," "somebody," "nobody" use singular verbs:

  * Somebody left the door open.
  * Nobody knows the answer.

### 📝 Lesson 9: Adjectives & Adverbs

Boost your English with words that add description and detail — adjectives describe things, and adverbs describe actions.

#### **What’s the Difference?**

* **Adjectives** describe nouns:

  * Example: A tall building, a delicious cake.
* **Adverbs** describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs:

  * Example: She ran quickly, really tired, almost always.

#### **Try This!**

Find all the adjectives and adverbs in this mini-story:

“You absolutely won’t guess who I saw at the airport! The incredibly talented singer from that show — he was super friendly. I awkwardly said hello and politely asked for a photo. He smiled warmly and even signed my notebook. Such a cool moment!”

**Adverbs**:

* absolutely — modifies “won’t guess” (to what extent)
* awkwardly — modifies “said” (how)
* politely — modifies “asked” (how)
* warmly — modifies “smiled” (how)
* even — modifies “signed” (adds emphasis)

**Adjectives**:

* incredibly talented — modifies “singer” (intensifier + adjective)
* super friendly — modifies “he” (referring to the singer)
* cool — modifies “moment”

### 📝 Lesson 10: Phrasal Verbs & Collocations

#### **Phrasal Verbs**

Phrasal verbs are expressions that combine verbs with particles (adverbs or prepositions). They have meanings that may not be obvious from the individual words. Mastering phrasal verbs can make your speech sound more fluent and natural.

**Examples of Phrasal Verbs**:

* Work out: I usually work out 2 or 3 times a week.
* Wake up: What time do you wake up on the weekend?
* Turn down: Turn down the TV, it’s too loud!
* Throw away: Throw away any old cardboard in the recycling bin.
