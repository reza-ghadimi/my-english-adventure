### ✏️ Extra Grammar Notes

- **Nouns:**  
  Common nouns = general things (*book*, *city*)  
  Proper nouns = specific and capitalized (*Tehran*, *Harry Potter*)

- **Pronouns** help us avoid repeating nouns.  
  *I*, *you*, *she*, *ours*

- **Verbs** show what’s happening or how we feel.  
  *I laughed.* / *She studied.*

- **Adverbs** describe **how** something happens.  
  *He quickly ran.* / *She slowly spoke.*

- **Adjectives** add details to nouns.  
  *A red ball*, *an exciting movie*

- **Articles** make nouns clearer:  
  *A dog*, *An idea*, *The book*

- **Conjunctions** join thoughts:  
  *I was tired, so I went to bed.*

- **Prepositions** show place/time relationships:  
  *Before lunch*, *under the table*

- **Interjections** express emotion:  
  *Wow!*, *Oops!*, *Yikes!*

## 📝 Lesson 2: Verbs and Irregular Verbs

In this lesson, we will learn about **verbs** — the action words that are used to express actions, events, or states. Understanding the different types of verbs, especially **regular** and **irregular verbs**, is essential for mastering English tenses.

---

### 🔹 What Are Verbs?

Verbs are words that express actions or states. They are essential in every sentence and come in different forms based on tense (present, past, future).

**Example sentences**:  
- *She laughs loudly.* (Present)  
- *He walked to the store.* (Past)  
- *They have studied for the exam.* (Past Participle)

---

### 🔹 Regular and Irregular Verbs

Verbs can be categorized into two main types:

#### 1. **Regular Verbs**  
These verbs follow a **fixed pattern** when forming their past tense and past participle forms. The regular pattern is adding **-ed**, **-d**, or **-ied** to the base form.

**Examples**:  
- *Walk → Walked → Walked*  
- *Jump → Jumped → Jumped*  
- *Cook → Cooked → Cooked*

#### 2. **Irregular Verbs**  
These verbs do **not follow a fixed pattern**. The past tense and past participle forms must be memorized because they change in unpredictable ways.

**Examples**:  
- *Buy → Bought → Bought*  
- *Go → Went → Gone*  
- *Drink → Drank → Drunk*

---

### 🔹 Common Regular and Irregular Verbs

| Base Form   | Past Form   | Past Participle   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Regular Verbs** |             |                   |
| Reach       | Reached     | Reached           |
| Fry         | Fried       | Fried             |
| Press       | Pressed     | Pressed           |
| Cook        | Cooked      | Cooked            |
| **Irregular Verbs** |             |                   |
| Buy         | Bought      | Bought            |
| Choose      | Chose       | Chosen            |
| Fall        | Fell        | Fallen            |
| Stand       | Stood       | Stood             |
| Ride        | Rode        | Ridden            |

---

### 🔹 Understanding Irregular Verbs

Irregular verbs can be divided into four main groups to help you remember them more easily. Each group has its own pattern of change.

| Group   | Description                | Base Form  | Past Form | Past Participle |
|---------|----------------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Group 1** | All forms are the same     | Put        | Put       | Put             |
| **Group 2** | Same past and past participle | Bring      | Brought   | Brought         |
| **Group 3** | Same base and past participle | Become     | Became    | Become          |
| **Group 4** | All forms are different    | Wake       | Woke      | Woken           |

> 📘 **Note**: The key to mastering irregular verbs is **memorization**. Grouping them by their patterns can help, but you'll still need practice to get them right!

### 🚀 Why It Matters
