## 📝 Lesson 1: Parts of Speech

English has **9 parts of speech** that build sentences:

| Part             | Role                            | Examples                           |

## 📝 Lesson 2: Verbs & Irregular Verbs

**Verbs** = Action or state words.  
They change with tense:  
*She laughs* (present), *He walked* (past), *They have studied* (past participle)

---

### 🔹 Regular Verbs

Follow a pattern:  
*Walk → Walked → Walked*  
*Cook → Cooked → Cooked*

---

### 🔹 Irregular Verbs

No fixed rule — must be memorized:  
*Go → Went → Gone*, *Buy → Bought → Bought*

Grouped for easier learning:

| Group        | Example            |
|--------------|--------------------|
| All same     | Put → Put → Put    |
| Past = Participle | Bring → Brought → Brought |
| Base = Participle | Become → Became → Become |
| All different| Wake → Woke → Woken |

> 💡 Practice + repetition = mastery!

---

## 📝 Lesson 3: Subject-Verb Agreement

Learn how to match subjects and verbs correctly — a must for building good English sentences.

---

## 🔹 The Basics

- **Singular subject → Singular verb**  
  > *Emma **writes** a blog.*

- **Plural subject → Plural verb**  
  > *They **travel** every summer.*

---

## 🔹 Examples

| Singular                            | Plural                             |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| The cat **sleeps** on the couch.    | The birds **fly** in the sky.      |
| He **works** at a bookstore.        | Nurses **care** for patients.      |
| This phone **rings** loudly.        | Cars **honk** on busy streets.     |

---

## 🔹 Helping (Auxiliary) Verbs

Used in negatives or questions:

- ✅ *She **does** enjoy music.*  
- ✅ *They **do** cook at home.*  
- ❌ *She **do** enjoy...*  
- ❌ *They **does** cook...*

---

## 🔹 Special Cases

### ✔ Two Singular Subjects  
- *Tom and Lisa **bake** cookies together.*

### ✔ Indefinite Pronouns  
Words like *everyone, somebody, nobody* use **singular verbs**:
- *Somebody **left** the door open.*  
- *Nobody **knows** the answer.*

---

## 📝 Lesson 4: Adjectives & Adverbs

Boost your English with words that add **description** and **detail** — adjectives describe *things*, and adverbs describe *actions*.

---

## 🔹 What’s the Difference?

- **Adjectives** describe **nouns**  
  > *A tall building, a delicious cake*

- **Adverbs** describe **verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs**  
  > *She ran quickly, really tired, almost always*

---

## 🔍 Try This!

Find all the **adjectives** and **adverbs** in this mini-story:

> “You absolutely won’t guess who I saw at the airport! The incredibly talented singer from that show — he was super friendly. I awkwardly said hello and politely asked for a photo. He smiled warmly and even signed my notebook. Such a cool moment!”

---

✅ Adverbs (describe how, when, to what extent):

absolutely — modifies “won’t guess” (to what extent)

awkwardly — modifies “said” (how)

politely — modifies “asked” (how)

warmly — modifies “smiled” (how)

even — modifies “signed” (adds emphasis)

✅ Adjectives (describe nouns):

incredibly talented — modifies “singer” (intensifier + adjective)

super friendly — modifies “he” (referring to the singer)

cool — modifies “moment”

---

## 🔹 5 Types of Adjectives

| Type               | What it Describes                     | Example Sentence                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Quality            | Traits/characteristics                | “It was a *bright* and *quiet* room.”      |

| Number             | How many                              | “She bought *three* books.”                |
| Demonstrative      | Points out specific nouns             | “*Those* shoes are mine.”                  |
| Interrogative      | Used in questions                     | “*Which* color do you prefer?”             |

---

## 🔹 3 Types of Adverbs

| Type              | What it Tells You                   | Example Sentence                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Manner            | How something happens               | “He danced *gracefully* on stage.”           |
| Degree            | Intensity or extent                 | “It’s *too* hot to go outside.”              |
| Affirmation       | Certainty or confirmation           | “*Definitely*, I’ll be there by 5.”          |

---

📘 *Adjectives help you describe things. Adverbs help you describe how things happen. Use both to sound more natural and expressive!*

## 📝 Lesson 5: Phrasal Verbs & Collocations

In this section, we dive into **phrasal verbs** and **collocations**, which are essential for sounding more like a native English speaker. These aspects of English will help you understand how words are commonly paired together in everyday language.

### 🔹 **Phrasal Verbs**
Phrasal verbs are expressions that combine verbs with particles (adverbs or prepositions). They have meanings that may not be obvious from the individual words. Mastering phrasal verbs can make your speech sound more fluent and natural.

#### Examples of Phrasal Verbs:
- **Work out** – I usually work out 2 or 3 times a week.
- **Wake up** – What time do you wake up on the weekend?
- **Turn down** – Turn down the TV, it’s too loud!
- **Throw away** – Throw away any old cardboard in the recycling bin.
- **Look for** – I’m looking for my phone, I lost it last night.

### 🔹 **Transitive vs. Intransitive Phrasal Verbs**
- **Transitive Phrasal Verbs**: These require an object after the verb.
  - Example: “I’ve always looked up to Bill Gates.”
  
- **Intransitive Phrasal Verbs**: These cannot have an object; they work alone.
  - Example: “She’s really grown up.”

### 🔹 **Separable vs. Inseparable Phrasal Verbs**
- **Separable Phrasal Verbs**: These can have words between the verb and particle.
  - Example: “Give my phone back to me.”
  
- **Inseparable Phrasal Verbs**: These cannot have words inserted between the verb and particle.
  - Example: “Please look after my pet goldfish.”

### 🔹 **Common Phrasal Verbs**
Here are some more common phrasal verbs:
- **Put on**: Why don’t you put on your favorite shirt today?
- **Pass out**: We ran so far we nearly passed out!
- **Hold on**: Hold on, I’ll be with you in just a minute.
- **Give up**: I should really give up smoking this year.

---

### 🔹 **Collocations**
Collocations are combinations of words that are commonly used together. Understanding collocations can help you speak more naturally and sound fluent.

#### Examples of Collocations:
- **Adverb + Adjective**:  
  “I won’t leave a review until I’m **completely satisfied**.”
  
- **Adjective + Noun**:  
  “I feel **ridiculously tired** this morning.”

- **Noun + Noun**:  
  “My little brother is getting really **cheeky**.”

- **Verb + Expression with Preposition**:  
  “I **come from** a very big family.”

- **Verb + Noun**:  
  “We watched an **action movie** at the cinema.”

- **Verb + Adverb**:  
  “He’s been reading **quietly** for an hour now.”

---

### 🔹 **Using Phrasal Verbs and Collocations**
- **Be mindful of context**: Phrasal verbs and collocations often depend on the situation. Make sure you know when and where to use them.
- **Don’t overuse them**: While phrasal verbs and collocations are important for fluency, using them excessively may sound forced. Focus on using them naturally.

> **Tip**: Try using a phrasal verb or collocation in a sentence today to practice its use!

## 📝 Lesson 6: Idioms, Contractions, and Informal Language

In this section, we explore essential aspects of informal and spoken English: **idioms**, **contractions**, and **slang**. Mastering these elements will help you sound more natural and fluent in everyday conversations. 

### 🔹 **Idioms**
Idioms are phrases that have meanings different from the individual words. They're commonly used in casual conversations. Here are a few examples:

- **Hang in there!** – Stay persistent, don’t give up.

- **Top banana** – The best person or thing.
- **Time flies when you’re having fun** – Time passes quickly when you're enjoying yourself.

Contractions help make speech faster and more casual by shortening words or phrases. For instance:

- “**It’s** freezing today!”  
- “**He’s** not very interested.”  
- “**I don’t** like football.”

### 🔹 **Slang**
Slang refers to informal, often playful words or expressions used in specific regions or by certain groups. It’s important to understand when and where to use slang appropriately:

- **Informal settings**: Use slang with friends or in casual settings.
- **Formal settings**: Avoid slang in professional or serious contexts.

#### Examples of Slang:

- **Bail** – To leave abruptly.  
  _“I had to bail on the party early, I wasn’t feeling well.”_
  
- **Hang out** – To spend time with friends.  
  _“Let’s hang out at the park tomorrow.”_
