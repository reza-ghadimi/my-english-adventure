## 📝 Lesson 1: Parts of Speech

English has **9 parts of speech** that build sentences:

| Part             | Role                            | Examples                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 🧍 Noun           | Person/place/thing               | David, city, book                  |
| 🙋 Pronoun        | Replaces nouns                   | He, she, it                        |
| 🏃 Verb           | Action/state                     | Run, laugh, is                     |

| 📰 Article        | Defines nouns                    | A, an, the                         |
| 🔗 Conjunction    | Connects ideas                   | And, but, because                  |
| 📍 Preposition    | Shows place/time                 | In, on, after                      |
| 🎉 Interjection   | Expresses emotion                | Wow!, Oh no!                       |

> 📌 These are the building blocks of clear, correct sentences.

## 📝 Lesson 2: Verbs & Irregular Verbs

**Verbs** = Action or state words.  
They change with tense:  
*She laughs* (present), *He walked* (past), *They have studied* (past participle)

---

### 🔹 Regular Verbs

Follow a pattern:  
*Walk → Walked → Walked*  
*Cook → Cooked → Cooked*

---

### 🔹 Irregular Verbs

No fixed rule — must be memorized:  
*Go → Went → Gone*, *Buy → Bought → Bought*

Grouped for easier learning:

| Group        | Example            |
|--------------|--------------------|
| All same     | Put → Put → Put    |
| Past = Participle | Bring → Brought → Brought |
| Base = Participle | Become → Became → Become |
| All different| Wake → Woke → Woken |

> 💡 Practice + repetition = mastery!

---

## 📝 Lesson 3: Subject-Verb Agreement

Learn how to match subjects and verbs correctly — a must for building good English sentences.

---

## 🔹 The Basics

- **Singular subject → Singular verb**  
  > *Emma **writes** a blog.*

- **Plural subject → Plural verb**  
  > *They **travel** every summer.*

---

## 🔹 Examples

| Singular                            | Plural                             |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| The cat **sleeps** on the couch.    | The birds **fly** in the sky.      |
| He **works** at a bookstore.        | Nurses **care** for patients.      |
| This phone **rings** loudly.        | Cars **honk** on busy streets.     |

---

## 🔹 Helping (Auxiliary) Verbs

Used in negatives or questions:

- ✅ *She **does** enjoy music.*  
- ✅ *They **do** cook at home.*  
- ❌ *She **do** enjoy...*  
- ❌ *They **does** cook...*

---

## 🔹 Special Cases

### ✔ Two Singular Subjects  
- *Tom and Lisa **bake** cookies together.*

### ✔ Indefinite Pronouns  
Words like *everyone, somebody, nobody* use **singular verbs**:
- *Somebody **left** the door open.*  
- *Nobody **knows** the answer.*

---

## 📝 Lesson 4: Adjectives & Adverbs

Boost your English with words that add **description** and **detail** — adjectives describe *things*, and adverbs describe *actions*.

---

## 🔹 What’s the Difference?

- **Adjectives** describe **nouns**  
  > *A tall building, a delicious cake*

- **Adverbs** describe **verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs**  
  > *She ran quickly, really tired, almost always*

---

## 🔍 Try This!

Find all the **adjectives** and **adverbs** in this mini-story:

> “You absolutely won’t guess who I saw at the airport! The incredibly talented singer from that show — he was super friendly. I awkwardly said hello and politely asked for a photo. He smiled warmly and even signed my notebook. Such a cool moment!”

---

✅ Adverbs (describe how, when, to what extent):

absolutely — modifies “won’t guess” (to what extent)

awkwardly — modifies “said” (how)

politely — modifies “asked” (how)

warmly — modifies “smiled” (how)

even — modifies “signed” (adds emphasis)

✅ Adjectives (describe nouns):

incredibly talented — modifies “singer” (intensifier + adjective)

super friendly — modifies “he” (referring to the singer)

cool — modifies “moment”

---

## 🔹 5 Types of Adjectives

| Number             | How many                              | “She bought *three* books.”                |

| Interrogative      | Used in questions                     | “*Which* color do you prefer?”             |

## 🔹 3 Types of Adverbs

| Type              | What it Tells You                   | Example Sentence                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Manner            | How something happens               | “He danced *gracefully* on stage.”           |
| Degree            | Intensity or extent                 | “It’s *too* hot to go outside.”              |
| Affirmation       | Certainty or confirmation           | “*Definitely*, I’ll be there by 5.”          |

📘 *Adjectives help you describe things. Adverbs help you describe how things happen. Use both to sound more natural and expressive!*
