# 📚 My English Adventure

Welcome to My English Adventure – a simple, beginner-friendly guide to learning and practicing English grammar.

These notes are based on my personal learning experience with the Udemy course "English Speaking – Complete English Language Mastery (2025-2)". All content has been rephrased, summarized, or extended in my own words to support understanding.

📝 This is not an official course copy. No copyrighted material is included — just personal notes and interpretations shared in the spirit of free learning and community support.

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up on your skills, I hope this helps you grow more confident in English!
